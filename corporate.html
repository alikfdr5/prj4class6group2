          <p>fjkdfhkdfjkgd </p>
          <p> <strong>Brand Logo</strong></p>
          <p> For the logo we combined two main values of our brand - computer innovation and support. The heart symbolizes love, care, and support. However, we combined it with geometrical figures to represent the innovative and technological part of the brand.  </p>
          <h4 id="production-1" class="mt-2">Design Elements</h4>
          <p>For our brand, we wanted to combine innovation and kno</p>

                  #05F66D
                  <em>Green often resembles personal growth. We used it to convey a sense of vitality and energy, which could be relevant for the parents that aim to support children's development and well-being, which is our vission as a brand.</em>
                </li>
                <li>

                  #04D4D0
                  <em>Blue is often associated with trust. Therefore, we used it to represent reliability, as our mission is to create reassurence in the parents and we want them to feel confident that the advice and recommendations provided by our brand are trustworthy and accurate.</em>

                  <em>This vibrant shade of purple adds up to the futuristic and modern look to our brand as innovation is one of the values of the brand. </em>

              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Fonts: <br>
              Round pop: This font adds to the futuristic and innovatiove look which relates to our value - innovation. <br>
              Fira sans: This is a clear font. We used it to make our text easy and accessible to read.
              
            </li>
            <li>UI elements (e.g. grids, carousels, menu organizations etc.) <br>
            <strong> Navigation bar</strong> - we made the navigation bar a very contrast and bright color to make it distinguish with the other white background of the website. This makes it easy for the users to navigate. We also choose a clear and bolded font to make it easy for the user to navigate. We also used simple, short and easy to comprehend words and phrases like 'Home','Fund us' and 'About us' to  make it easier for users to navigate and find what they are looking for.   <br>
            <strong> Buttons </strong> - we used buttons with contrast to catch the attention of the users and to make them more likely to be clicked. Also, when the mouse is put on the button, it changes it's color, so it is more clear to the user which one of the buttons they are choosing. We also used them in the 'Landing page' to make it easier and more accessible for the users to go to the most important page of the website - the funding page or if they are not ready to fund us yet, to make them check the 'About us' page. <br>
            <strong>Carousel</strong>- we used the carousel not only to make the website more interactive and entertaining, but also to show less information on the page and not overload the users with text so they are more likely to read it. <br>
            <strong> Form </strong> - we used the form to make the funding possible, by letting the users provide the information required to make a successful bank transaction <br>
            <strong> Checkboxes </strong> - we put the checkboxes on the blue background to make them contrast with everything else on the page. We decided to use them to make the funding accessible, easy and clear, and to ensure that the user knows how much they are donating.<br>
            <strong> Pop up text</strong> - we put a pop up text after the user had put their details, to ensure them that they have done it correctly.
          </li>
          <li>Others<br>
            <strong> Video </strong> - we used a video in the 'Landing page' to catch the attention of the users and to give them short and clear information about what our brand and product is in order to make them intrigued and more likely to continue looking through the website and donate.
            <strong> Icons </strong> - we used three icons in the 'About us' page to make the page more entertaining, but also to give insights about what the text next to them is about.
          </li>
        
            <li> <u>Navigation, pages and content </u> <br>
            <strong> Landing page</strong> - On the 'Landing page' of our website we put a video to catch the attention of the users and to inform them briefly about our brand. Below the video, we put a question.  By asking a question related to the button, we are giving the user a clear idea of what action they will take when they click on the button. This can help to reduce confusion and make it more likely that the user will click on the buttons.  Additionally, asking a question can help us to personalize the user experience and make the user feel more connected to your website. The two buttons lead to the other two important pages of the website - the 'Fund us' page and 'About us'. We put a footer at the end to promote our Facebook page. <br>
            <strong> Fund us </strong> -
